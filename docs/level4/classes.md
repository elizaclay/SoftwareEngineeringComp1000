# Classes

In this session, we will look at a very important language feature of C++, that is creating and using **class types**.

Most of the code we have seen uses the *baked in* data types, including `char, short, int, long, float, double`.

We have also **used** other types, including `string`, `ofstream` and `ifstream`. We use these **custom data types** to create a special type of variable we call an **object**. This is the basis of a very important concept, that is **Object Orientated Programming**, or **OOP**.

In this section, we will learn to **create** out own custom data types using the `class` keyword. These are similar to C structures, only there is a lot more you can do with it.
